        "expanded": [
            "Badly Drawn Boy, the stage name of Damon Gough, is a solo project where Gough plays multiple instruments. In his live performances, he is often accompanied by a few backing musicians, but the majority of the instrumentation is handled by Gough himself. Wolf Alice, on the other hand, is a four-piece band consisting of Ellie Rowsell, Joff Oddie, Joel Amey, and Theo Ellis. While they do occasionally incorporate additional instruments or guest musicians, their core sound is built around the four members.\n\nGiven these arrangements, it's clear that Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument-to-person ratio. With Gough handling the bulk of the instrumentation, he often plays 5-7 instruments during a performance, including guitars, bass, drums, and keyboards. This means he has an instrument-to-person ratio of around 5-7:1. In contrast, Wolf Alice's four members typically play 2-3 instruments each, resulting in an instrument-to-person ratio of around 2-3:1.\n\nAs for the average number of instruments used per band member, Damon Gough's solo project naturally gives him a higher average. With Gough playing 5-7 instruments, his average is, well, 5-7 instruments per band member (since he is the only member). Ellie Rowsell, on the other hand, plays 2-3 instruments as part of Wolf Alice, giving her an average of 2-3 instruments per band member.",
            "Badly Drawn Boy, being a solo project of Damon Gough, has a surprisingly high instrument-to-person ratio. As the primary instrumentalist, Gough often plays multiple instruments simultaneously, incorporating a wide range of instruments into his music, including guitars, keyboards, drums, and more. In contrast, Wolf Alice, a four-piece band, has a more traditional rock setup with each member playing a primary instrument. While Wolf Alice's sound is certainly rich and layered, Badly Drawn Boy's solo nature means he has a higher instrument-to-person ratio. Moreover, due to his solo setup, Badly Drawn Boy's instrumental sound is more prominent relative to the number of members, as every sound and instrument is contributed by a single person. In Wolf Alice, the instrumental sound is more distributed among the four members, making Badly Drawn Boy's sound more instrumentally dense and prominent by comparison.",
            "Badly Drawn Boy, a solo project of Damon Gough, is a one-man band that often features a multitude of instruments in his performances and recordings. In contrast, Wolf Alice is a four-piece band consisting of Ellie Rowsell, Joff Oddie, Joel Amey, and Theo Ellis. When comparing the two, it becomes clear that Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument-to-person ratio, as one person plays multiple instruments, whereas Wolf Alice has four members contributing to their sound. Furthermore, Badly Drawn Boy's music is more instrument-dense compared to the number of people involved in its creation, as he often incorporates a wide range of instruments, from guitars and drums to keyboards and strings, to create a rich and layered sound. In contrast, Wolf Alice, as a four-piece band, divides the instrumental responsibilities among its members, resulting in a more distributed sonic landscape."
