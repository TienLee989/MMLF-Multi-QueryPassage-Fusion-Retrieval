        "expanded": [
            "Teacher tenure is a policy that grants teachers a permanent contract after a probationary period, usually 3-5 years, during which they are evaluated for their performance and fit with the school district. The primary purpose of tenure is to provide job security and protection from arbitrary or unjust dismissals, allowing teachers to focus on teaching and making decisions that benefit their students without fear of reprisal. This, in turn, promotes academic freedom and allows teachers to take risks and innovate in their teaching practices.",
            "Teacher tenure offers several benefits to the education system. For one, it attracts and retains top talent in the teaching profession, as job security and stability are key considerations for many educators. Tenure also encourages teachers to develop a long-term commitment to their students and schools, leading to better student outcomes and a more stable learning environment. Additionally, tenure protects teachers from biased or discriminatory evaluations and provides a due process for addressing grievances, ensuring that teachers are treated fairly and with respect.",
            "While teacher tenure has its benefits, it also has potential drawbacks. One criticism is that it can make it difficult to remove underperforming teachers, which can negatively impact student learning outcomes. Tenure can also create a sense of complacency among teachers, reducing their motivation to innovate and improve their practice. Furthermore, the tenure process can be time-consuming and costly, diverting resources away from other important educational priorities. Some argue that these drawbacks outweigh the benefits, and that alternative forms of job security, such as multi-year contracts, could be more effective in promoting teacher quality and accountability."

The aerosol emitted by e-cigarettes can contain harmful substances such as ultrafine particles, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds, which can irritate the lungs and increase the risk of respiratory diseases. Furthermore, the nicotine present in e-liquids can lead to addiction, and the high levels of nicotine in some products can be particularly dangerous for youth and young adults.",
            "While e-cigarettes are often marketed as a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products, the evidence suggests that they are not entirely safe. Although they do not contain the same level of toxic chemicals as tobacco smoke, they can still expose users to harmful substances. In fact, many e-liquids contain flavorings and other chemicals that have not been tested for safety when inhaled. Moreover, the long-term health effects of vaping are not yet fully understood, and some e-cigarette products have been found to contain known carcinogens. Therefore, it is premature to consider e-cigarettes a safe alternative to tobacco products.",

            "Tax exemption allows churches to allocate more resources towards their charitable and community-focused activities, rather than diverting funds towards tax payments. This enables churches to provide essential social services, such as food banks, homeless shelters, and youth programs, which benefit the broader community. Additionally, tax exemption encourages philanthropy, as donors can claim tax deductions for their contributions to exempt organizations. This, in turn, supports the societal benefits that churches provide, including promoting social cohesion, fostering community engagement, and supporting marginalized populations.",
            "While some argue that churches may abuse their tax-exempt status by engaging in political activities or accumulating excessive wealth, there are existing safeguards to prevent such abuse. The Johnson Amendment, for example, prohibits tax-exempt organizations from participating in political campaigns or influencing elections. The IRS also provides guidance on permissible political activity and monitors compliance. Furthermore, churches are still required to file annual information returns (Form 990) with the IRS, which discloses their financial activities and ensures transparency. These measures help to prevent abuse and ensure that churches use their tax-exempt status for their intended purpose: serving the public good."

            "Legalizing gay marriage can have numerous benefits for same-sex couples and society as a whole. For one, it provides equal rights and recognition to all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation. This can lead to increased happiness, health, and well-being among LGBTQ+ individuals, as they feel valued and accepted by society. Additionally, legalizing gay marriage can also have economic benefits, as it can attract businesses and tourists who value diversity and inclusivity. Furthermore, it can also help to reduce discrimination and promote greater understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals, leading to a more harmonious and equitable society.",
            "Some arguments against legalizing gay marriage include concerns about the definition and purpose of marriage, religious beliefs, and potential consequences for religious freedom and traditional values. For example, some argue that marriage is primarily for procreation and that same-sex couples cannot biologically have children together. Others argue that legalizing gay marriage could lead to a slippery slope, where other forms of marriage, such as polygamy, are also legalized. Additionally, some religious groups may argue that gay marriage goes against their beliefs and values. However, many of these arguments have been countered by the fact that marriage is a fundamental right, and the government should not discriminate against certain groups based on their sexual orientation.",
            "Views on gay marriage vary widely across different societies and cultures. Some countries, such as the Netherlands, Canada, and Australia, have legalized gay marriage, while others, such as many African and Middle Eastern countries, criminalize same-sex relationships. In the United States, there is a mix of laws and attitudes, with some states legalizing gay marriage and others banning it. In some cultures, such as in many Indigenous communities, same-sex relationships have historically been accepted and even celebrated. Understanding these different perspectives can help us learn from each other and promote greater understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals worldwide."

            "Cell phone radiation refers to the form of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation emitted by cell phones and other wireless devices. This type of radiation is also known as radiofrequency (RF) energy, which is a form of electromagnetic energy that is used to transmit information through the air. Cell phones emit RF radiation when they send and receive signals to and from cell towers, Wi-Fi routers, and other devices. This radiation is measured in units of frequency, typically in terms of hertz (Hz), and power density, typically in terms of watts per kilogram (W/kg).",
            "When cell phone radiation is absorbed by the human body, it can cause heating of the tissues, which can lead to a range of biological effects. The amount of radiation absorbed by the body is measured by the specific absorption rate (SAR), which varies depending on the phone's power output, frequency, and distance from the body. Some research suggests that prolonged exposure to high levels of cell phone radiation can increase the risk of certain health problems, such as cancer, brain damage, and reproductive issues. However, the scientific evidence on the health effects of cell phone radiation is still limited and inconclusive.",
            "To ensure public safety, governments and regulatory agencies around the world have established guidelines and safety limits for exposure to cell phone radiation. For example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States sets a maximum SAR of 1.6 W/kg for cell phones, while the European Union sets a maximum SAR of 2 W/kg. Additionally, many countries have implemented measures such as limiting the sale of child-friendly phones, promoting safe phone use habits, and encouraging manufacturers to design phones with lower SAR values. While these limits are in place, some experts argue that they may not be sufficient to protect public health, and that more research is needed to determine safe exposure levels."

            "Marijuana, also known as cannabis, has been shown to have several potential medical benefits. Studies have found that it can be effective in relieving chronic pain, reducing inflammation, and improving symptoms of multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. It has also been used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, as well as to stimulate appetite in patients with wasting diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Additionally, some research suggests that marijuana may have anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential treatment option for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and arthritis.",
            "While marijuana may have potential medical benefits, it is not without risks and side effects. Long-term use of the drug can lead to dependence and addiction, and it can impair cognitive function, memory, and judgment. It can also increase heart rate and blood pressure, which can be problematic for people with pre-existing heart conditions. Additionally, smoke from marijuana contains many of the same cancer-causing chemicals as tobacco smoke, which can increase the risk of respiratory problems. Furthermore, marijuana use during pregnancy or breastfeeding can have negative effects on fetal or infant development.",
            "When considering marijuana as a medical option, it's essential to weigh its benefits and risks against those of other treatment options. For some conditions, such as chronic pain, marijuana may be a safer alternative to opioids, which are highly addictive and have contributed to a national epidemic of overdose deaths. However, for other conditions, such as anxiety or depression, there may be more established and effective treatments available, such as therapy or prescription medications. Ultimately, the decision to use marijuana as a medical option should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual's specific needs and medical history, as well as the availability of other treatment options."

This wage has not kept pace with inflation, and its purchasing power has decreased over time. As a result, many full-time minimum wage workers struggle to make ends meet, and some even fall below the poverty line.",
            "Increasing the federal minimum wage could have several benefits for workers, businesses, and the economy as a whole. For example, a higher minimum wage could help to reduce poverty and income inequality, as low-income workers would have more disposable income to spend on goods and services. This, in turn, could boost economic growth and job creation. Additionally, a higher minimum wage could improve worker productivity and morale, leading to reduced employee turnover and training costs for businesses.",
            "Opponents of increasing the federal minimum wage argue that it could have negative consequences, such as higher unemployment rates, particularly among low-skilled and teenage workers. They also argue that small businesses and startups might struggle to absorb the increased labor costs, which could lead to job losses or even business closures. Furthermore, some argue that a higher minimum wage could lead to inflation, as businesses pass on the increased labor costs to consumers through higher prices.\n\nThese sub-queries and passages provide a foundation for a more informed discussion on whether the federal minimum wage should be increased."

Many argue that it violates the right to life, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and that it is a form of cruel and inhumane punishment. The death penalty also disproportionately affects marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities, and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Furthermore, the risk of wrongful convictions and executions of innocent people is a significant concern. In light of these considerations, many argue that the death penalty is incompatible with human rights and should be abolished.",
            "Proponents of the death penalty often argue that it is necessary to punish the most heinous crimes. However, critics argue that alternative punishments, such as life imprisonment without parole, can effectively punish and rehabilitate criminals. This approach allows for the possibility of rehabilitation and redemption, while also keeping society safe from the offender. Additionally, life imprisonment can be just as punitive as the death penalty, without the risk of executing an innocent person or perpetuating a cycle of violence. Some argue that focusing on rehabilitation and restorative justice can be a more effective and humane approach to addressing crime."

To discharge student loan debt, borrowers must prove that repaying the loan would cause \"undue hardship,\" which is a high threshold to meet. This requires showing that they cannot maintain a minimal standard of living, that their financial situation is likely to persist, and that they have made good-faith efforts to repay the loan. This process can be time-consuming, expensive, and often unsuccessful, leaving many borrowers with limited options.",
            "Making student loan debt easier to discharge in bankruptcy could have several benefits. For one, it could provide relief to borrowers who are struggling to repay their loans and are facing financial distress. This could, in turn, stimulate economic growth as these individuals would have more disposable income to invest in their communities. Additionally, easier discharge could reduce the number of borrowers who default on their loans, which would save the government money in the long run. Furthermore, it could also help to reduce the rising levels of delinquency and default in the student loan market, which have negative consequences for the entire economy.",
            "While making student loan debt easier to discharge in bankruptcy might provide relief to individual borrowers, it also has potential drawbacks. One concern is that it could create a moral hazard, where borrowers take out large loans without intending to repay them, knowing that they can discharge them in bankruptcy. This could lead to a surge in defaults and potentially destabilize the student loan market. Another issue is that making it easier to discharge student loan debt could increase the cost of borrowing for future students, as lenders would need to account for the increased risk of default. This could limit access to education for some students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds."

One approach is to strengthen officiating and increase the severity of penalties for dirty or violent plays. Another approach is to promote a culture of respect and sportsmanship among players, coaches, and fans. Additionally, leagues can implement rules and regulations that encourage clean play, such as stricter rules on checking and hitting, and increased use of video review to hold players accountable for their actions.
