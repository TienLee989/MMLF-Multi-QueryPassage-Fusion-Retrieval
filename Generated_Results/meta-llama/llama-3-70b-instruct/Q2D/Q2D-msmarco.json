        "expanded": "In anthropology, the environment is broadly defined as the total complex of physical, biological, and cultural factors that surround and influence human beings. This definition encompasses not only the natural environment, including geography, climate, and ecosystems, but also the social and cultural contexts in which humans live. The anthropological definition of environment emphasizes the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between humans and their surroundings, recognizing that humans shape their environments through technology, social organization, and cultural practices, while also being shaped by them. This perspective highlights the importance of understanding the ways in which environmental factors, such as resource availability and distribution, influence human behavior, social structures, and cultural systems, and how, in turn, human activities impact the environment. By adopting a holistic and relativistic approach, anthropology seeks to uncover the diverse ways in which environments are perceived, used, and managed across cultures, and to addresses the environmental challenges that confront human societies in the present day."

        "expanded": "Axon terminals, also known as synaptic knobs, are the distal ends of an axon, a long, slender extension of a neuron that carries electrical signals away from the cell body. The axon terminal is the region where the axon forms a connection with another neuron, muscle fiber, or gland cell, transmitting the electrical signal to the target cell. At the axon terminal, the axon expands to form a bulb-like structure called a synaptic knob or bouton, which contains a high concentration of small vesicles called synaptic vesicles. These vesicles store neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that facilitate communication between neurons. When an electrical signal reaches the axon terminal, the synaptic vesicles release their neurotransmitters into the synapse, the small gap between the axon terminal and the target cell. The released neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the surface of the target cell, transmitting the signal and allowing communication between the two cells. In summary, axon terminals or synaptic knobs are specialized structures at the ends of axons that facilitate the transmission of electrical signals between neurons or from neurons to other cells."

        "expanded": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a condition where the left ventricle of the heart becomes thickened, leading to reduced heart function and increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The causes of LVH are multifaceted and can be broadly classified into two categories: pressure overload and volume overload. \n\nPressure overload causes include systemic hypertension, aortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta, which result in increased pressure against which the heart must pump blood. This leads to cardiac remodeling, where the heart muscle thickens to compensate for the increased pressure, ultimately resulting in LVH. \n\nVolume overload causes, on the other hand, include aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and ventricular septal defects, which cause the heart to pump more blood than usual to compensate for the excess volume. This increased workload also leads to cardiac remodeling and LVH. \n\nOther potential causes of LVH include cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and genetic disorders, such as Friedreich's ataxia. Additionally, certain lifestyle factors, including excessive exercise, thyroid disorders, and pregnancy, can also contribute to the development of LVH. Early diagnosis and management of underlying causes are crucial to preventing the progression of LVH and reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications."

        "expanded": "Military suicide is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects service members and veterans worldwide. While there is no single cause, research has identified several factors that contribute to the risk of suicide among military personnel. One of the primary causes is the psychological and emotional toll of combat exposure. The trauma and stress of war can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, which are all significant risk factors for suicide. Additionally, the military culture of stoicism and self-reliance can make it difficult for service members to seek help for mental health issues, further exacerbating the problem. \n\nOther causes of military suicide include the strain of repeated deployments, family and relationship problems, and access to firearms. The transition from military to civilian life can also be a challenging period, as veterans may struggle to find employment, adjust to a new routine, and cope with the loss of camaraderie and purpose. Moreover, the stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment, as well as the fear of being perceived as weak or unfit for duty, can prevent service members from seeking the help they need. Finally, underlying mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder and substance abuse, can also increase the risk of suicide among military personnel."

In other words, as x gets larger, f(x) gets larger. For instance, if x = 1, f(x) = 2, and if x = 2, f(x) = 4, which is greater than 2. Similarly, if x = 3, f(x) = 8, which is greater than 4. This pattern continues for all values of x, making f(x) = 2^x a monotonic function.\n\nAnother example of a monotonic function is the logarithmic function f(x) = log(x). This function is also monotonic because as the input x increases, the output f(x) also increases. For instance, if x = 1, f(x) = 0, and if x = 2, f(x) = log(2), which is greater than 0. Similarly, if x = 4, f(x) = log(4), which is greater than log(2). This pattern continues for all values of x, making f(x) = log(x) a monotonic function.\n\nMonotonic functions can be increasing, decreasing, or constant. The examples above are increasing monotonic functions because the output increases as the input increases. A decreasing monotonic function would have the opposite behavior, where the output decreases as the input increases. A constant monotonic function would have the same output for all inputs."

        "expanded": "While most sharks are ectothermic, meaning their body temperature is regulated by the surrounding water, some species of sharks have evolved to be partially endothermic, or warm-blooded. This means that they are able to maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. These sharks, known as regionally endothermic sharks, have a specialized circulatory system that allows them to conserve heat in certain parts of their bodies. One example of such a shark is the salmon shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), which is able to maintain a body temperature up to 14\u00b0C (25\u00b0F) higher than the surrounding water. This is achieved through a countercurrent heat exchange system in its gills, where the cool blood flowing into the gill filaments is warmed by the outgoing blood, allowing the shark to retain heat. Additionally, some sharks, such as the mako shark (Isurus spp.), have a high metabolic rate, which generates heat internally, helping to maintain a higher body temperature. This unique adaptation allows these sharks to thrive in cold waters and gives them a competitive advantage over other species."

The life cycle of a flea consists of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The female flea lays eggs on the host, usually in batches of 2-5, which hatch into larvae within 2-3 weeks. The larvae feed on the host's skin debris and flea dirt (dried blood) for about 1-2 weeks before spinning a cocoon and entering the pupal stage. After about 2-3 weeks, the adult flea emerges from the pupa and begins searching for a host to feed on. Once it finds a host, the cycle begins again. Adult fleas can live for several months without feeding, but they typically die within 2-3 weeks if they don't find a suitable host."

The midsegment of a trapezoid is the line segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of the trapezoid. Here's how to find it:\n\nFirst, identify the two non-parallel sides of the trapezoid and label them as AB and CD. Next, find the midpoints of these two sides. The midpoint of AB can be found by averaging the coordinates of points A and B. Let's call this midpoint M. Similarly, find the midpoint of CD, which we'll call N.\n\nOnce you have the midpoints M and N, draw a line segment connecting them. This line segment MN is the midsegment of the trapezoid. Note that the midsegment is always parallel to the parallel sides of the trapezoid and has a length that is equal to the average of the lengths of the parallel sides.\n\nFor example, if the trapezoid has parallel sides of length 6 cm and 8 cm, then the length of the midsegment would be (6 + 8) / 2 = 7 cm. By following these steps, you can easily find the midsegment of any trapezoid."

One major reason was Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, which resulted in the sinking of the passenger ship Lusitania in 1915, killing over 1,000 civilians, including 128 Americans. This incident outraged the American public and put pressure on the government to take action. \n\nAnother significant factor was the Zimmermann Telegram, a secret message sent by Germany to Mexico in 1917, urging it to declare war on the United States. This was seen as a direct threat to American national security and sovereignty. Furthermore, the UK's interception and decryption of the telegram, which was made public in March 1917, helped to sway public opinion in favor of entering the war. \n\nAdditionally, the US economy had become increasingly intertwined with that of the Allied powers, with American banks and businesses invested heavily in the war efforts of Britain and France. As a result, the US government felt compelled to protect its economic interests and ensure that the Allied powers, to whom it had extended significant credits, remained solvent. \n\nFinally, President Woodrow Wilson's idealistic goals of \"making the world safe for democracy\" and spreading American values also played a role in the decision to enter the war. Wilson, who had initially campaigned on a platform of keeping the US out of the conflict, eventually came to see American participation as essential to achieving a lasting peace and shaping the post-war world order. On April 2, 1917, Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany, and on April 6, the US formally entered World War I."

        "expanded": "Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are two popular wireless technologies used for different purposes. Wi-Fi is a type of wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or communicate with each other through a wireless network. It uses radio waves to transmit data between devices, typically over short distances, such as within a home or office building. Wi-Fi is commonly used to provide internet access to devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets, as well as to connect devices to a local network.\n\nBluetooth, on the other hand, is a wireless personal area network (PAN) technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over short distances, typically within a range of 30 feet. It is commonly used to connect devices such as headphones, speakers, keyboards, and mice to a computer or mobile device. Bluetooth is used for device-to-device communication, enabling the exchange of data, voice, and video between devices.\n\nThe key differences between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth lie in their purpose, range, and data transfer speed. Wi-Fi is designed for high-speed internet connectivity and has a longer range than Bluetooth. Wi-Fi connections are typically faster than Bluetooth, with speeds of up to several hundred megabits per second. Bluetooth, with its slower data transfer rate, is better suited for device-to-device communication and is often used for audio streaming, file transfer, and other low-bandwidth applications.\n\nIn summary, Wi-Fi is used for wireless internet connectivity and local networking, while Bluetooth is used for device-to-device communication and peripheral connectivity. While both technologies enable wireless communication, they serve distinct purposes and have different capabilities."

For many Thais, the day begins early, with a visit to the local market or a street food stall to grab a quick breakfast of steaming hot noodles, fragrant jasmine rice, or crispy fried insects. \n\nThe workday typically starts around 8 or 9 am, with many people commuting to offices, shops, or factories in crowded cities like Bangkok or Chiang Mai. However, in rural areas, life is slower-paced, and people often spend their days tending to their farms, fishing, or engaging in traditional crafts. \n\nFamily and social life play a significant role in Thai daily life. Thais are known for their strong sense of community, and it's common to see families gathering for meals, festivals, or special occasions. Respect for elders and tradition is deeply ingrained, with young people often showing deference to their seniors by performing the traditional 'wai' greeting, where they press their palms together and bow their heads.\n\nReligion also plays a vital part in daily life, with many Thais visiting temples or spirit houses to make offerings, pray, or seek guidance from monks. The common sight of orange-robed monks collecting alms in the early morning is a testament to the strong Buddhist roots of the country. \n\nAfter a long day, Thais often unwind with a visit to the local night market, where they can sample street food, buy souvenirs, or simply socialize with friends and neighbors. Later in the evening, families may gather to watch TV, play games, or enjoy traditional music and dance performances. \n\nThroughout the day, Thais prioritize respect, kindness, and hospitality, often referring to their country as the 'Land of Smiles.' This warm and welcoming atmosphere is what makes daily life in Thailand so unique and endearing to visitors from around the world."

        "expanded": "Spruce trees are a type of evergreen coniferous tree that can vary in size and shape depending on the specific species. However, most spruce trees share certain physical characteristics. They typically have a conical or columnar shape, with a single main trunk that tapers gradually towards the top. The bark of a spruce tree is usually grayish-brown in color, thin, and scaly, with horizontal lines or furrows. The branches are usually stiff, horizontal, and whorled, meaning they grow in a circular pattern around the trunk. The needles of a spruce tree are a distinctive feature, being square-shaped in cross-section, typically 1-2 inches long, and attached to the branches in a spiral pattern. The needles are often a bright green color on the top and have two white bands of stomata on the underside. The cones of a spruce tree are cylindrical, 2-6 inches long, and hang downward from the branches. Overall, spruce trees can grow to varying heights, ranging from 30 to 100 feet or more, with some species like the Sitka spruce reaching heights of over 150 feet."

        "expanded": "An active margin is a region on the Earth's surface where tectonic plates are actively interacting, resulting in the formation of mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. It is an area where the lithosphere, the outermost solid layer of the planet, is being deformed and transformed due to the movement of the tectonic plates. Active margins can be found at the boundary between two plates that are converging (moving towards each other), diverging (moving apart), or sliding past each other horizontally.\n\nAt an active margin, the Earth's crust is being stretched, compressed, or pulled apart, leading to the creation of various geological features such as mountain ranges, oceanic trenches, and fault lines. Volcanic activity is also common at active margins, as the movement of the plates can cause magma to rise to the surface. The process of plate tectonics drives the formation of these features, and the resulting landscapes are constantly changing as the plates continue to move.\n\nExamples of active margins include the Andean mountain building process in South America, the San Andreas Fault in California, and the Japanese island arc system. These regions are prone to natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis due to the ongoing tectonic activity. Understanding active margins is crucial for geologists to reconstruct the Earth's history, predict natural hazards, and better comprehend the dynamic processes that shape our planet."

        "expanded": "Contour plowing is a farming technique that has several environmental benefits, particularly in reducing soil erosion and runoff. By plowing across a slope, rather than up and down it, contour plowing can reduce soil erosion by up to 90%. This is because the furrows act as a barrier, slowing down water flow and allowing it to infiltrate the soil more easily. As a result, contour plowing can also reduce the amount of sediment and pollutants that enter nearby waterways. Additionally, contour plowing can reduce the loss of fertile topsoil, which is often rich in nutrients and organic matter. By reducing soil erosion and runoff, contour plowing can also help to reduce the need for fertilizer and other soil amendments, which can further reduce environmental impacts. Overall, contour plowing is an important conservation tillage practice that can help to protect soil health and reduce environmental degradation."

The movement's name is derived from the claim that only three percent of American colonists took up arms against the British during the American Revolution. The Three Percenters believe that they are the modern-day equivalent of these revolutionaries, fighting against what they see as a tyrannical government that has overstepped its constitutional bounds.\n\nThe movement has its roots in the 1990s, but it gained significant traction in the 2000s and 2010s, particularly during the presidency of Barack Obama. The Three Percenters' ideology is often associated with anti-government sentiment, constitutional originalism, and a strong belief in individual liberties and gun rights. They see themselves as defenders of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and are fiercely opposed to what they perceive as government overreach and encroachment on their freedoms.\n\nWhile the movement is often described as a militia, the Three Percenters do not fit the traditional definition of a militia. They are a loosely organized group with no centralized leadership or chain of command. Instead, they are a network of individuals and groups who share similar beliefs and values. Many Three Percenters are veterans, outdoorsmen, and gun enthusiasts, and they often organize themselves into local groups or \"units\" to prepare for what they see as a potential collapse of society or government.\n\nThe Three Percenters have been involved in several high-profile incidents, including the 2014 Bundy standoff in Nevada and the 2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. These events have raised concerns about the movement's willingness to engage in armed conflict with law enforcement and its potential for violence. However, many Three Percenters argue that they are peaceful and non-violent, and that their goal is to defend their rights and freedoms through political activism and education rather than armed rebellion."
